        <div class="card">
            <p><strong>Strength is quiet.</strong><br>You never had to raise your voice to be respected. Your presence
                alone was power.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <p><strong>Patience is love in action.</strong><br>Even on your toughest days, you gave time, energy, and
                wisdom without hesitation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <p><strong>Consistency builds trust.</strong><br>You showed up. Always. No matter what. Even Sometimes you
                are busy with work you , we understand. That taught me what reliability means.</p>
